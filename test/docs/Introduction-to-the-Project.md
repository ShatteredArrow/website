## Hack for LA Website (HackforLA.org)

The HackforLA.org website’s purpose is to connect volunteers with projects, code for America and Hack for LA’s shared mission and let external stakeholders know that we are producing valuable projects with tangible impact.  The website is also the place that new developers often start, moving on to more complex projects after they have mastered docker, git, github and working collaboratively on a multidisciplinary team.

### History

The new website team was formed when the website was one page and required a code change to something easier to update. This website displayed a handful of projects, an email signup form and a focus on getting people to come to our 3 weekly hack nights with information being hosted on meetup. 

### COVID-accelerated Development

COVID-19 safer at home policies created urgency to move all the teams to fully remote, and redesign the onboarding methodology from in-person and being driven by meetup, to online driven by a variety of new recruiting sources.

* Launch of a step-by-step getting started guide
* Creation and integration of an onboarding video
* Creation of an online team meeting schedule and API integration with VRMS to make the information able to be updated by project managers in the future
* Github API integration to display project languages alongside static project information
* Creation of an analytics dashboard to display and analyze all the survey data being gathered
* Created wiki that details all aspects of hackforla.org website code for new developers

### HackforLA.org under development for launch in coming three months

### And where are we going from here?

We are in the process of developing a product roadmap that will chart out a future 6-12 months of development. We will continue taking into account past feedback, which includes the following:

The primary functions of the Hack for LA website is to recruit and match prospective volunteers to ongoing technology projects. The website must achieve two key goals: (1) present a clear and compelling value proposition for participation; (2) enable interested volunteers to identify and join projects that align with both their areas of interest and skills.  

Earlier HFLA discovery research found that ~25% of survey respondents felt the website’s UI/UX could be improved. Nearly 1 in 5 respondents could not find all the information they sought. In descending order, the top three categories of information sought are: 

1. Volunteer opportunities 
2. Current project information 
3. Other - Includes information about GitHub and Python workshops, working examples of past successful projects, what goes on at Meetup meetings, and whether beginner-level technologists can join.  

The current presentation of project cards on the home page forces users to scroll in a cumbersome way through one or more pages. This makes it difficult to find and locate projects of interest quickly. And the project cards do not provide a clear call to action to prospective volunteers.
