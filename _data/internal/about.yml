    Dear Jerry,

    With years of success in the industry, I am ready to join Capital Industries as your next CEO. I have a track record of identifying growth opportunities in the cloud computing industry over the past 15 years. I am seeking to leverage my exceptional company management, capital fundraising, and software application engineering abilities in a new challenge. I work well with established, talented teams to spearhead new markets.

    As Chairman and CEO of Century Industries, I am responsible for providing the visionary leadership for a $10.5 million technology company offering a cloud-based Platform as a Service (PaaS) for the natural gas industry in the Midwest. My hands-on ability to work with clients in the field resulting in numerous successful partnerships.

    Please review a list of my career highlights:

    Co-Founder and President/CEO of CloudOne, a specialized Quality of Service (QoS) Platform using PaaS business model with $35 million in total revenue – negotiated $50 million exit with Amazon Web Services.
    Grew Century Industries personnel from 50 to 250 and delivered revenue growth from $6 million to $10.4 million.
    Expanded market share for Intraserve, Inc. data access service from 30 percent to 45 percent over two years, increasing profit margins by 40 percent, with higher quality services.
    I researched into the background of Capital Industries after our initial discussions about the role. With a new market strategy, your engineers and sales teams will be a great foundation to begin creating new products. I am ready to lead Capital Industries to new heights of success.
