description: Each of the 80+ Code for America Brigades is an experiment which generates
  valuable learnings and new effective processes and practices. However, Brigades
  and other civic tech volunteer organizations need not start from scratch. This project
  aims to improve existing structures and create new ones that make it easier to share
  replicable processes and practices so that organizers and members can iterate on
  each others work, improving outcomes for the whole network. <br><br> The Civic Tech
  Structure's first project seeks to improve the existing Code for America Brigade
  Organizer’s Playbook (BOP) into a communal, high-value resource for sharing. We
  will be performing an intensive UX Research phase with the BOP end users to understand
  their priorities, infrastructure, and potential contributions.

Our Civic Tech Structure project is responsible for publishing all of our guides and other reference materials that we hope will help other people and organizations to stand on the shoulders of those who contributed before them."
